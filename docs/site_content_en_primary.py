<section>
  <h2>Move from task to rhetorical function</h2>
  <p>Academic writing is easier to revise when every sentence has a job. A literature review may define a field, organise positions, compare findings, identify uncertainty, or establish a research gap. A discussion may interpret a result, connect it to prior work, bound its scope, and explain an implication. These functions are related, but they are not interchangeable.</p>
  <p>Before drafting, write a plain-language label beside each paragraph: context, problem, evidence, interpretation, limitation, or contribution. If a paragraph needs three labels, its logic may need to be separated. Once the sequence is clear, use the <a href="{{link:phrase_explorer}}">Phrase Explorer</a> to find a pattern for the specific move.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Control stance across a paragraph</h2>
  <p>Stance is not a single hedge added near a verb. It is the relation among evidence quality, claim strength, scope, and certainty. Direct evidence can support an assertive descriptive claim. Observational evidence can support association, but it normally cannot support an unqualified causal statement. Contextual evidence may motivate a question without resolving it.</p>
  <div class="reference-table" role="region" aria-label="Academic writing decisions" tabindex="0">

        <tr><td>State a gap</td><td>Define the unresolved issue</td><td>Is the gap specific and demonstrable?</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Interpret a result</td><td>Offer a bounded explanation</td><td>Could another mechanism fit the evidence?</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Conclude</td><td>Return to contribution and limits</td><td>Does the conclusion exceed the analysis?</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </div>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Revise for continuity and precision</h2>
  <p>Read the first sentence of every paragraph as a sequence. The sequence should reveal the paper's argument without relying on formulaic transitions. Then inspect each claim for its evidence anchor. A citation must still support the same proposition after a rewrite. A number must retain its unit, comparison group, interval, and direction. Negation and limiting words such as only, may, within, and under should be treated as protected meaning.</p>
  <p>Finish with a compression pass. Remove phrases that repeat the claim without adding logic. Prefer a precise subject and verb over abstract nominalisations when the actor or process matters. Keep technical terms when a shorter synonym would change disciplinary meaning.</p>
</section>
<aside class="article-note">
  <h2>Quick revision check</h2>
  <p>Can you name the move, point to its evidence, state its scope, and explain why its level of certainty is justified? If not, revise the reasoning before the wording.</p>

<section>
  <h2>Keep methods reproducible and claims traceable</h2>
  <p>A methods section should let a qualified reader understand the population, materials, variables, procedures, exclusions, estimand, and analysis. Name choices that affect interpretation. Passive voice can be useful when the procedure matters more than the actor, but it should not hide who made a judgment or how a classification was assigned.</p>
  <p>Link every reported estimate to the corresponding method. If a model changes across analyses, state the adjustment set and purpose. If missing data, multiplicity, measurement error, or sensitivity analysis affects the result, report it where readers can connect the issue to the estimate.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Separate observation from interpretation</h2>
  <p>Results sections should report direction, magnitude, uncertainty, and the comparison being made. Statistical significance alone is not an interpretation of practical or scientific importance. Give the estimate and interval where appropriate, preserve units, and avoid translating a non-significant result into proof of no effect.</p>

<section>
  <h2>Treat causal language as a design claim</h2>
  <p>Words such as caused, led to, reduced, improved, and prevented make claims about counterfactual change. They require more than a strong association. A credible causal statement depends on design, identification assumptions, temporal ordering, confounding control, measurement, and analysis. When those conditions are not met, use descriptive or associational language and state the remaining uncertainty.</p>
  <p>Search terms such as <a href="{{link:phrase_explorer}}?q=cautious%20interpretation">cautious interpretation</a> or <a href="{{link:phrase_explorer}}?q=observational%20association">observational association</a> surface patterns whose evidence requirements can be checked before use.</p>

<section>
  <h2>Protect meaning before changing form</h2>
  <p>A successful paraphrase is not measured by synonym count or surface difference. It is measured by whether the rewritten sentence makes the same supported claim. Begin by marking protected elements: citations, names, numbers, units, intervals, technical terms, negation, comparison direction, population, setting, time, modality, and causal status.</p>
  <p>Consider this source statement: Study A reported no increase in outcome Y after 12 weeks (Lee, 2024). A safe rewrite must retain the negative finding, the outcome, the 12-week period, and the citation. Changing no increase to reduced, or omitting the time period, changes the claim.</p>

<section>
  <h2>Use a constraint-first workflow</h2>
  <ol class="workflow-list compact">
    <li><strong>Extract invariants</strong><span>List evidence, numbers, relations, and qualifying terms that cannot change.</span></li>
    <li><strong>State the proposition plainly</strong><span>Write the supported meaning without trying to sound polished.</span></li>
    <li><strong>Rebuild the sentence</strong><span>Change structure and emphasis while retaining disciplinary terms that carry exact meaning.</span></li>
    <li><strong>Run a bidirectional check</strong><span>Ask whether the source entails the rewrite and whether the rewrite adds any unsupported proposition.</span></li>
  </ol>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Watch for quiet forms of drift</h2>
  <p>Meaning often changes through small edits. May becomes will. Associated with becomes led to. Some participants becomes participants. Higher than becomes different from. A result limited to one setting becomes a general claim. A citation moves to a sentence containing a new proposition it did not support.</p>
  <p>When a passage is already concise, highly technical, or legally fixed, paraphrasing may be the wrong goal. Quote briefly when quotation is justified and permitted, cite the source, or retain the technical wording while rewriting the surrounding explanation. Never paraphrase to conceal dependence on a source.</p>

  <h2>Why local-first matters</h2>
  <p>Many paraphrase services ask writers to paste drafts into a remote form and pay for stronger limits. Lugas takes a different route. The public app is static, installable, and free. It can build a prompt without any endpoint, or call only the endpoint you enter.</p>
  <p>Output can be Indonesian (EYD V) or English, independent of the interface language. The meaning check runs in the browser without AI: numbers with decimal commas, statistics, citations, quotations, negation in Indonesian and English, hedges, association versus causation, direction, and scope. The app stores no manuscripts on a Lugas server because the web version has no manuscript server.</p>

  <h2>Why there is no daily cap</h2>
  <p>Endpoint calls use your own model, token, and quota, so a browser-side cap protects nobody's costs. Earlier versions limited calls to three per day; that cap was removed. Requests stop after 90 seconds and can be cancelled.</p>
  <p>A true shared-key hosted service needs a backend. The planned design is a small Worker API, a D1 table for anonymous daily quota, a KV cache for rate-limit decisions, Turnstile for abuse resistance, provider tokens stored only as server secrets, and manuscript logging disabled by default. That backend is intentionally separate from the current static app.</p>
