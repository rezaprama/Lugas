<section>
  <h2>What a research gap is</h2>
  <p>A research gap is not a dramatic statement that a topic has never been studied. It is a bounded account of what available evidence does not yet establish. The gap may concern a population, setting, mechanism, measure, method, time period, inconsistency, or unanswered comparison. It should lead directly to a question the present study can address.</p>
  <p>Build the claim from the <a href="{{link:literature_review}}">literature review</a>. Record the search scope, distinguish missing evidence from mixed evidence, and cite the studies that define the boundary. If the search was narrow, describe it as narrow.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Patterns for specific gaps</h2>
  <p class="phrase-template">Although [established finding] has been documented in [studied context], evidence regarding [specific unresolved issue] remains limited in [target context].</p>
  <p class="phrase-template">Studies differ in their estimates of [relation], leaving the role of [specific source of uncertainty] unresolved.</p>
  <p>The first pattern fits a coverage gap. The second fits inconsistent findings. Replace every bracket with facts supported by the review and preserve any uncertainty in the cited literature.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Connect the gap to the study</h2>
  <p>After stating the gap, explain why resolving it matters and how the research aim responds. Do not claim importance through generic language. Name the scientific, theoretical, methodological, clinical, or policy decision affected by the uncertainty. Then state an aim whose design, sample, and measures can actually address the stated issue.</p>
  <p>Search the <a href="{{link:phrase_explorer}}?q=research%20gap">Phrase Explorer</a> for additional patterns and inspect their evidence requirements.</p>
</section>

  <h2>Warning</h2>
  <p>A missing citation in your search is not proof that no study exists. Avoid first, never, and no research unless a documented, comprehensive review supports those words.</p>

<section>
  <h2>Define the review's analytical frame</h2>
  <p>A literature review explains the state of knowledge relevant to a research decision. Choose an organising frame before drafting: competing theories, methodological families, populations, settings, outcomes, time, or patterns of agreement and disagreement. The frame should help the reader understand why studies can or cannot be compared.</p>
  <p>Create an evidence table with study design, sample, measure, estimate, limitation, and relevance. This prevents a polished synthesis from merging results that address different questions.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Write relations among studies</h2>
  <p class="phrase-template">Across [group of studies], estimates consistently indicate [shared pattern], although [design or population difference] limits direct comparison.</p>
  <p class="phrase-template">Whereas [study group A] reports [finding], studies using [method B] find [contrasting finding], suggesting that [bounded source of variation] warrants examination.</p>
  <p>Each pattern requires more than multiple citations. The cited studies must support the relation expressed by across, consistently, whereas, or contrasting. Use <a href="{{link:hedging}}">academic hedging</a> when evidence is mixed or indirect.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Move from synthesis to the research problem</h2>
  <p>End a thematic unit by stating what the synthesis establishes and what remains uncertain. A gap should follow from the reviewed evidence, not appear as an unsupported pivot. Link the limitation to the present aim only when the study can address it.</p>
  <p>Use the <a href="{{link:phrase_explorer}}?q=literature%20synthesis">Phrase Explorer</a> to retrieve comparison and synthesis patterns. Keep every citation attached to the proposition it supports.</p>

<section>
  <h2>Build the thesis spine</h2>
  <p>Write four plain statements before polishing chapters: the problem, the research question, the design used to answer it, and the bounded contribution. These statements form the thesis spine. Each chapter should either establish a premise, document the response, report evidence, or interpret what that evidence supports.</p>
  <p>Map the spine across chapters. The <a href="{{link:research_gap}}">research gap</a> must lead to the aim. The methods must operationalise the aim. The results must answer the stated analyses. The discussion must not introduce a stronger question or broader population.</p>

  <p>Signposting should expose logical relations, not narrate document mechanics. Avoid repeatedly announcing that a chapter will discuss a topic when you can state the question or claim directly.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Revise across boundaries</h2>
  <p>Compare terminology, variables, population labels, and claim strength across the abstract, introduction, results, discussion, and conclusion. Track every major conclusion backward to a result and method. Track every question forward to an answer or an explicit statement that it remains unresolved.</p>
  <p>Use <a href="{{link:preserve_claim_strength}}">Preserve Claim Strength</a> when rewriting the abstract or conclusion, where compression often creates overclaiming.</p>

<section>
  <h2>Report the design before procedural detail</h2>
  <p>Name the study design, setting, dates, population, sampling process, inclusion criteria, and unit of analysis. Then explain measures, interventions or exposures, outcomes, procedures, exclusions, and analytic choices. The order should follow the logic needed to interpret the estimates, not merely the chronology of project administration.</p>

  <h2>Give each result a complete reference frame</h2>
  <p>A result needs the outcome, groups or condition compared, direction, magnitude, unit, and uncertainty where appropriate.

  <p>Do not replace an estimate with a significance label. A small p-value does not show practical importance, and a large p-value does not establish no effect. Report intervals and discuss what values remain compatible with the data.</p>

  <h2>Keep design limits visible</h2>
  <p>Observational results should normally use associated with, differed, or was related to rather than caused, improved, or prevented.
